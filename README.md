## Process:

Install and Create a Virtual Environment 

```
pip install virtualenv
```

```
virtualenv bankapp
```

After creating Virtual environment, we need first direct our directory to ```bankapp``` by using ```cd bankapp``` then Scripts folder by using ```cd Scripts```  
Then use ```activate``` command.

Then download my github repository from 
```
https://github.com/Surya-24/Secure_Bank
``` 
or clone my github repository by using
```
git clone -q https://github.com/Surya-24/Secure_Bank
``` 

Then change the directory to Secure_Bank folder by 
```
cd Secure_Bank
``` 

Then install the requirements using requirements.txt file which is present in the repository itself. Packages can be installed by using                             
 
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

After successful installation of packages present in requirements.txt, there is one last package named ```dlib```, for installation of this package firstly go to 
``` 
https://github.com/Surya-24/Secure_Bank/blob/main/dlib-19.22.99-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
``` 

then download the file using download option in the github. After downloading the file, ```copy the path``` where the file is  downloaded then come back to command prompt where we have installed packages related to the project, now use the command     
```
pip install ‚Äúpaste the path here\dlib-19.22.99-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl‚Äù 
```
Please don't paste the exact command and press enter, in the place of "paste the path here" paste the path which we have copied earlier.

If there is an error make sure you are using ```Python 3.9.1``` version or above. 

If there is no error, we are good to run the WebApp. 

For running the app, firstly we need to create the database 

Make sure you are in ```Secure_bank``` directory, if not use ```cd Secure_bank```, then follow the steps:  
- [ ] python
- [ ] from bank import db 
- [ ] db.create_all() 
- [ ] exit() 



Now database is created successfully in the local machine and the app is ready to use 

Now make sure the directory is unchanged, it should be in Secure_bank directory, if not use ```cd Secure_bank``` 

Now use command 
```
python run.py 
```
 ![Command Prompt Image](https://github.com/Surya-24/images_for_readme_files/blob/main/cmd%20pic.png?raw=true)

If the shown picture is displayed then the app is running successfully on the local machine. 

Now the last step is to open any browser like Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Brave. 

In the search bar paste the given link in the Command Prompt or simply type http://localhost:5000/ and check link to be inserted or explore the website. 

Thank You üòÉ
